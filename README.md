# OCR-with-Google-API
Hello everyone!

Now I did an excesise to automate OCR (Object C Recognition) using jupyter notebooks and Google's Vision API.

This is a very basic example of how it can work.

If you are starting to use APIs please make sure you understand how they work and how to connect to them. I found a very usefull video on Youtube and actually I make my script with this guy's help. Please take a look at Parts 1,2 and 3.
